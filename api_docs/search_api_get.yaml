summary:
  - Finds table by various criteria
parameters:
  - name: status
    description: Each table is assigned a status based on the following criteria<br>- <strong>current</strong> Tables with the most up-to-date available information<br>- <strong>archived</strong> Tables with older versions of data<br>- <strong>deprecated</strong> Tables that have data that is no longer supported
    in: query
    example: current
    schema:

        - archived
        - deprecated
      required: false
  - name: program
    description: Filter the BigQuery tables by programs such as CCLE, TARGET and TCGA by using this filter. <em>Use an underscore character, "_", to replace a space character</em>.
    in: query
    example: broad_institute
    schema:
      type: string
      required: false
  - name: category
    description: The tables are grouped into four high-level categories<br>- <strong>clinical_biospecimen_data</strong> Patient case and sample information (includes clinical tables with patient demographic data, and biospecimen data with detailed sample information).<br>- <strong>metadata</strong> Information about raw data files including Google Cloud Storage Paths (includes tables with information about files available at the GDC, including GCS paths, creation dates, sizes, etc.). <br>- <strong>processed_-omics_data</strong> Processed data primarily from the GDC (i.e. raw data that has gone through GDC pipeline processing e.g. gene expression, miRNA expression, copy number, somatic mutations, methylation). <br>- <strong>reference_database</strong> Genomic and Proteomic information that can be used to cross-reference against processed -omics data tables (examples include ClinVar, cytoBand, dbSNP, Ensembl, Ensembl2Reactome).<br><br><em>Use the pipeline character, '|', between the values if adding more than one category.</em>
    in: query
    example:  metadata | reference_database
    schema:
      type: string
      required: false
  - name: friendlyName
    in: query
    description: Filter by the table's Friendly Name; that is, a descriptive, user-friendly name for the table. Type all or a portion of the name into the field to perform the search. For exact match, wrap the name in double quotes.

        - hg19
        - hg38
      required: false
  - name: source
    description: Filter by the source of the data. <br>- More than one source can be added to the filter by using the pipeline character, '|', as a delimiter.<br>- Use underscore, '_', to replace the space character.
    in: query
    example: GDC
    schema:
      type: string
      required: false
  - name: data_type
    in: query
    description: The Data Type filter also allows you to filter for data types of interest. Like the 'source' filter, multiple Data Types can be entered using a pipeline character '|' as a delimiter.
    example: clinical_data
    schema:
      type: string
      required: false
  - name: experimental_strategy
    in: query
    description: The Experimental Strategy filter also allows you to filter for experimental strategies of interest. Multiple Experimental Strategies can be selected.
    example: rnaseq
    schema:
      type: string
